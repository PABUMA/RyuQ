Installation
============
For the installation of the project we need Java 11, Maven and a IDE, like IntelliJ.
The download link of this IDE is: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

You also need a JDK version higher than 11.For the realization of this project, we have used JDK 14.
The following links will help us through the installation process.

On the other hand, you must download Maven. Here are two links on how to install maven on your computer:

For Windows 10: http://tutorialesparanovatos.blogspot.com/2015/06/instalar-maven-en-windows-8.html.

Once the necessary software tools are installed, we should add the Java and Maven variables to the Windows path.
On the other hand, to already work with the project, we must clone the git repository, there are three ways that are fine
described on the following website:
https://docs.github.com/es/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository.

In order to work with a specific branch, make updates or code mergers, we have
the following page: https://git-scm.com/book/es/v2/Ramificaciones-en-Git-Procedimientos-B%C3%A1sicos-para-Ramificar-y-Fusionar


After the steps described above, we will show these steps in a simplified way for our project.

First of all we have to indicate the directory where we want to clone the repository.For example, if it is the Documents folder, run cd Documents.
Once we have chosen the place where the repository will be cloned, we clone it by executing the command git clone https://github.com/PABUMA/RyuQ.git.
Another option to have the project on your computer is to download it as a .zip file and unzip it.
At this point you already have a local copy of the repository.

If you already have the repository and want to update it, the command: git pull will be used. If you have made changes to any
branch and you are going to update the project, it will be done with the command: git push.
