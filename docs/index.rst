RyuQ project: Trajectory-based metaheuristics for multiple sequence alignment
=============================================================================

RyuQ is a collaborative project of the students of the "Programación Avanzada in Bionformatics" subject
(Health Engineering degree, University of Málaga). The project focuses on implementing a set of trajectory-based
metaheuristics to optimize `multiple sequence alignment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment>`_
problems (MSA).
